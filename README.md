# atpgm.avrxml

AVR Tools XML Reader

This C# class library provides a interface for reading the XML based devices files from the Atmel Studio into object representations for further manipulation. This has been split off the atpgm project to allow easy reuse should the need to use the xml files for anything else arises.
